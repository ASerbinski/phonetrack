# PhoneTrack ownCloud/Nextcloud application

PhoneTrack is an app to get tracking information from mobile devices
and display them dynamically on a Leaflet map.

Go to [PhoneTrack Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/phonetrack) if you want to help to translate this app in your language.

How to use PhoneTrack :

* create a tracking session
* give the tracking URL\* to the mobile devices. Choose the method you prefer :
    * With a web browser, on the session public logging page, check "Log my position in this session" (works better on Android than on IOS...)
    * [OsmAnd gpx recording plugin](https://osmand.net/features?id=trip-recording-plugin#Online_tracking) (Android) is able to log to a custom URL with GET method. IOS version does not include recording plugin. Tested and approved.
    * [GpsLogger](http://code.mendhak.com/gpslogger/#features) (Android) Very good ! Setup in : Options -> Logging details -> Log to custom URL
    * [Owntracks](http://owntracks.org/) (IOS/Android) Both version work. This app does not work without google services installed on Android. Quite funny to provide an app for those who want to keep control of their tracking information and force them to be tracked by google services...
    * [Âµlogger](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.fabiszewski.ulogger/) (Android) The best IMHO. Very light. Bufferize positions when device looses connectivity and sends everything when back online.
    * [Traccar](https://www.traccar.org/client/) (IOS/Android) Quite good, not very verbose. Also able to bufferize.
    * [OpenGTS](http://opengts.org/) which is more a standard than an app. I successfully used [GpsLogger](http://code.mendhak.com/gpslogger/#features) (OpenGTS mode) and [CelltrackGTS/Free](http://www.geotelematic.com/CelltracGTS/Free.html) (a few bugs with this one).
    * Does anyone know good and free ([as in "free speech"](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)) app which can log position to custom URL in background ? Create an issue if you do !
* Watch the session's devices positions in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack normal or public page

(\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the URL. Replace "yourname" with the desired device name. Setting the device name in logging app only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.

On PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :

* edit/add/delete points
* restrict autozoom to some devices
* display position history display (path lines)
* rename a session/device
* change a device color, move it to another session
* share a session to other users (read-only)
* make a session public and share it via a public link. Positions are not visible in web logging page "publicWebLog" for private sessions.
* import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track by device).
* display session statistics
* filter points (any criterias combination)
* reserve a device name to make sure only authorized user can log with this name
* toggle session auto export (daily/weekly/monthly)

Public page works like main page except there is only one session displayed and there is no need to be logged in.

This app is tested with Owncloud 10/Nextcloud 12 with Firefox 56+ and Chromium.

This app is under development.
